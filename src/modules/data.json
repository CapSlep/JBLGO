It's a durable exterior and I love the little loop for attaching to bags for days out. Really great design and seems like it will last. Very easy to set up it took seconds to connect. Easy to use with simple buttons and charges fast I find that the battery gas lasts days we have had it on holiday and take it for drives , days out etc and only charged it once all week. I love it and know i will use it all the time it's an ideal size for popping in/ on a bag . Lightweight.",

It stood out the most while golfing. I bought a small carabiner clip to attach the speaker to my golf bag and I can't describe how perfect it was: out of the way, terrific and clear sound with deep bass and plenty of volume. The speaker easily lasted the entire round and most of the way into a round the next day. Also, I found this speaker to be extremely nice to bring hiking, working in the garage, and cleaning up around the house. I was very pleasantly surprised to hear the quality of the sound (even at high volumes) in an array of spaces and the speaker had plenty of power to keep going. Anyone looking for anything from a small desk speaker to a tag along for adventures, this speaker is the right one.",
