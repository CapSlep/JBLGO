Perfect for my work in an industrial environment. The Bluetooth connection is flawless. The buttons are easy to understand and use. It has a well-made braided hook. The sound is great for its size, honestly, I didn't think it would be good for my work, but I was wrong. I use it for 8 hours at work, and the battery holds up well at 60-75% volume. Recharges in less than an hour, at least that's my experience. It's also a great gift. I don't have two, or I could make them work in stereo mode. I haven't used that feature, but it's available.",

It has a durable exterior, and I love the little loop for attaching to backpacks for outings. Great design and seems durable. Very easy to set up, took seconds to connect. Simple to use with easy buttons, and it charges quickly. The battery lasted me for several days, we took it on holiday for road trips and outings, etc., and only charged it once the entire week. I love it and know I’ll be using it all the time, the perfect size to slip into a bag. Lightweight.",

I bought a small carabiner to attach the speaker to my golf bag, and I can’t describe how perfect it was: out of the way, incredible clear sound with deep bass and plenty of volume. The speaker easily lasted the whole game and most of the ride the next day. Additionally, I found this speaker extremely enjoyable to carry on hikes, work in the garage, and clean around the house. I was pleasantly surprised by the sound quality (even at high volume) in various spaces, and the speaker had enough power to keep up. For those looking for a small desk speaker or an adventure companion, this speaker is the one.",
